 Test the Application:

 + Run without any argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/hello
  A subcommand is required
  Run with --help for more information.
#+END_SRC

 + Show help.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/hello -h
  hello
  Usage: bin/hello [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

  Options:
    -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit

  Subcommands:
    run                         Run some application
    path                        Show content of $PATH environment variable
    relaunch-pid                Relaunch a process, given its PID
