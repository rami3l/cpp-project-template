# Project template for Command Line Application with CLI11 Library

This is a project template for a command line application with
subcommands, akin to GIT (git commit, git submodule, git push) built on top of the [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) C++11 library for command line parsing.

It's based on the following template: [`caiorss/cpp-project-templates`](https://github.com/caiorss/cpp-project-templates/tree/master/command-line-app-cli11).
