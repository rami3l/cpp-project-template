# C++ CLI App Project Template: `conan` + `cmake`

This is a project template for a CLI application with
subcommands, akin to GIT (git commit, git submodule, git push) utilizing the [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) library for argument parsing.

The skeleton is built with `conan` + `cmake`, and is heavily based on the following template: [`caiorss/cpp-project-templates`](https://github.com/caiorss/cpp-project-templates/tree/master/command-line-app-cli11).

See `Makefile` for the usage.
